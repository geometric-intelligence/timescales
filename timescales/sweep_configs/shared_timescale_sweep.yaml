# Shared Timescale Sweep
# 
# Research Question: When all neurons share a single learnable timescale,
# what value does the network converge to? Does it match the behavioral timescale?
#
# Comparison: This is a control experiment for the multi-timescale sweep.
# If the network can only learn one timescale for all neurons, what does it pick?
#
# Experiment design:
# - All neurons share a SINGLE learnable timescale (scalar parameter)
# - Each experiment starts with a different initial timescale
# - Same behavioral timescale (τ_behavior = 1.0s) for all
# - Compare final learned τ across initializations
#
# Total experiments: 8 init values × 2 activations = 16 experiments
