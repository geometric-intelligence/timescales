# Timescale Means Sweep: Neural vs Behavioral Timescale Matching
# 
# Research Question: What is the optimal neural timescale for a given 
# behavioral timescale? Is there a matching principle?
#
# Key insight: With zero heterogeneity, we test whether τ_neural ≈ τ_behavioral
# is optimal, or if some other relationship holds.
#
# Expectations:
# - τ_neural << τ_behavioral: Network forgets too fast to integrate
# - τ_neural >> τ_behavioral: Network too sluggish to track rapid changes  
# - τ_neural ≈ τ_behavioral: Potentially optimal (matched dynamics)
#
# Total experiments: 13 neural_mean × 13 behavioral_mean = 169 experiments
